# Hotel-Booking-App

Hello and welcome to a marketplace app with similar concept used by sites like eBay, Udemy E-commerce
Marketplace Online Service, looking, for example, for car servicing, hotel booking, beauty parlor
booking, etc..

So this app will allow users to post services or products on this site.
We just will be able to buy those products or services and you as a platform owner will collect money
from customers and pay back to sellers.
So while doing that, the owner will take his percentage as a platform fee or commission for being a platform
owner.
So there will have two different types of users.
One is seller.
We will sell products or services, for example, or hotel owner who will post his hotel rooms available
for booking.
The other type is buyer who will buy products or services, for example, or user who want to book a
hotel room.

React hooks, redux, MongoDB , node js and stripe are used to build
this marketplace.

We have separate API and separate front end webapp such marketplace that needs to be extremely
fast and high performant.

So we use react for that.
Nodejs and Mongodb are used to build our API in client side.
React and Redux are used for building the front end.
Stripe is used as a payment system provider.

So in this marketplace app, the owner will be taking money from customers and payout to sellers while keeping
his charge as a platform fee.
